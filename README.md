<h1 style="background-color:tomato;">Hey peoples!</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph. It should be at least 8 sentences. I don't know what to write here. Oh well. Hey, I only need 4 more sentences! Horray! Oh wait, this is the last senctence.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph. Yes, I'm Back! Wait, I should use my sentences sparingly. You never know how many you have left. AHH I ONLY HAVE 4 SENTENCES LEFT! AHHHHHH! TWO LEFT! LAST SENTENCE!</p>
<p>This is the final paragraph. This time, I won't talk for years at a time. 2056: I have survived without using a single sentence for thirty years, but I am using one to tell anyone reading this that living off of the fact that you can't die as long as you have more sentences is stomach-renching; signing off. 2099: Nobody knows why I won't talk, but you do, and I am hungry. 3470: I can't take much more of this, 'cause I think I am going crazy but, on the upside, I got to live to see flying cars. 8792: I think I should use all of my sentences to end this horendus nightmare. 99999: Who knows how long I've been living; for all I know, it's been an infinite amount, but I think it's actually been 97973 years since I became attached to these paragraphs. 100000: This is the last sentence and I am glad; GOODBYE WORLD!</p>
<p>JK, this is the last paragraph. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
